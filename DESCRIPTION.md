# Description
Our basic idea arose from a project task of our teaching company in the ZLI basic apprenticeship year. 
After several ideas we decided to make a simplified version of a Thememaker for BetterDiscord. 

Of the countless themes that can be downloaded from the internet, there are not always those that are available,
so we thought that everyone should have the possibility to create their own theme. Unfortunately not everyone can program a theme!

That was the reason and motivation to find a solution for this problem. That's how our **BetterDiscord-Theme** maker page was born!
We hope it can help you to find your dream theme and are open for further ideas to extend our page :D
